# frequency-hider
Frequency Hider allows you to shift your communications between frequencies in order to hide them from 
unwanted eavesdroppers.
Have you ever been in the middle of hacking a cyberspace when some pesky cop started listening to your frequencies?
Frequency Hider provides a simple-to-use, intuitive text-based interface that allows you to see which frequencies are
being listened to, and shift your own communications to a safe frequency of your choice.

## Getting Started
### Requirements
* **Python 2.7**
* **Python 3.4**
* **Internet Explorer 9**

* an **Occulus Rift** or similar VR headset
* a graphics card with a minimum of 3GB VRAM
* a 4K monitor
* a text editor of your choice
* a **Club Penguin** account with prepaid Membership for at least 6 months
* blood type O or AB
* an Internet connection with at least 16kbps download rate
* a refractor telescope with at least 70mm aperture
* **Arduino Uno** or **Arduino Mega**
* a human sacrifice under the age of 18

## Usage
To start Frequency Hider, simply run it from your command line.
Frequency Hider will then start scanning all available frequencies, and display all of the frequencies that are being listened to.

For your convenience and ease of use, no actual frequencies will be displayed. Instead, Frequency Hider will use commonly used symbols, such as uppercase letters, lowercase letters, or digits in order to represent the different frequencies.

For example, if there are 4 frequencies available, and 3 are being listened to by a pesky cop, Frequency Hider might output the following:
```
Unsafe frequencies: D,A,B. Frequency to shift to (A-D)?
```
In this case, the user must type C and press ENTER in order to shift to the only safe frequency - C.

Unfortunately, cops are very good at listening to frequencies, so you will have only a few seconds to shift the frequency
before the listener read your data.

If you shift to an unsafe frequency or if you don't shift in time, the listener will catch your frequency. Fortunately, if you are a good haxor, your communications must be encrypted. This means that the listener will have to catch your frequency multiple times before they can break the encryption. Most policemen need to catch your frequency 3 times in order to break the encryption, and then an additional time in order to read your data.
