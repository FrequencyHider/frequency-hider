# frequency-hider
Frequency Hider allows you to shift your communications between frequncies in order to hide your communications from 
unwanted eavesdroppers.
Have you ever been in the middle of hacking a cyberspace when some pesky cop started listening to your frequencies?
Frequency Hider provides a simple-to-use, intuitive text-based interface that allows you to see which frequncies are
being listened to, and shift your own communications to a safe frequency of your choice.
